## Usage

### Make payment

```jsx
import com.xpay.kotlinutils.XpayUtils
import com.xpay.kotlinutils.models.User

// set XpayUtils core settings
// The following settings are for testing purposes only
XpayUtils.apiKey = "Cce74Y3B.J0P4tItq7hGu2ddhCB0WF5ND1eTubkpT";
XpayUtils.communityId = "m2J7eBK";
XpayUtils.variableAmountID = 60;
// default server settings are testing servers which is equivalent to
// XpayUtils.serverSetting = ServerSetting.TEST

lifecycleScope.launch {
    try {
        val res = XpayUtils.prepareAmount(50)
        // read active payment methods list and set payUsing property
        // this test community returns CARD and KIOSK payment options
        // the following line is equivalent to XpayUtils.payUsing = PaymentMethods.CARD
        XpayUtils.payUsing = XpayUtils.activePaymentMethods[0]
        // read the total amount of card payment
        // this is also equivalent to
        // val totalAmount = res?.totalAmount!!
        val totalAmount = XpayUtils.PaymentOptionsTotalAmounts?.card!!
        // set billing information
        XpayUtils.userInfo = User( "John Doe", "j.doe@test.com", "+201111111111")
        // make payment
        val paymentRespone = XpayUtils.pay()
        // get payment form url and navigate to it to complete your payment
        val formUrl = paymentRespone?.iframe_url!!
        //in case of KIOSK payment method, read the message respone which contains your payment reference number from AMAN
        // val formUrl = paymentRespone?.message!!

        // that's it !
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        e.message?.let { msg -> displayError(msg) }
    }
}
```

### Get transaction info

// default server settings are testing servers which is equivalent to
// XpayUtils.serverSetting = ServerSetting.TEST

lifecycleScope.launch {
    try {
        val response = XpayUtils.getTransaction(it)
        // read transaction status and amount
        val status = respone.status
        val totalAmount = respone.total_amount

        // that's it !
    } catch (e: Exception) {
