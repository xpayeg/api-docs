4. Fill in the name and description that describe your payment type.

5. check **Is active** option.

6. if you want your payments to require a `<member_id>` field, check ** Require member id**, this id will not be validated, it will just be an internal info in your business, if you don't need it.. uncheck it.

7. if you want the payment iframe to redirect to a specific page after payment is done, fill in the url to redirect to in ** Redirect url** field. In the redirected url you will have the status of the transaction, the transaction id, and the member id if provided.

8. If you want the payment server to send a POST request to another server with transaction status, and details, after payment is done, fill in ** Callback url** field. The POST request body will have the status of the transaction, the transaction id, and the member id if provided.

:::info
The callback URL is only called when the transaction is accepted by our system, meaning the user completed the payment and received a response indicating the transaction was successful for a card payment or pending for kiosk / cash collection
:::

9. click **Save**.

10. you will be redirected back to **API Payment**, the new created template will appear.

11. save the value in the **ID** column for later.
