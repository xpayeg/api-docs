The XPay API uses API keys to authenticate requests.
You can view and manage your API keys in the XPay Dashboard.

API key is supplied in the request header with a key value pair with that structure

```json
"x-api-key" : string
```

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure!
Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.
