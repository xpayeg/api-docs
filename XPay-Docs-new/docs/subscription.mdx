One of the available payment tools that XPay offers is Recurring payments or Subscriptions.

If your service includes subscription based payments or any other form of recurring payments,
you can use our endpoints to create Recurring payments that can be used to charge your user
a fixed amount every set period of time with optional end date and the ability to cancel a subscription at anytime.

XPay Subscription endpoints allows you to:

1. Create a recurring payment (subscription)
2. Log all subscription bills with option to filter paid and unpaid bills
3. Pay for subscribtion bill/s
4. Cancel subscription

## How it works

When you create a subscription payment it starts generating bills for each period from the start date depending on the current date
and an optional end date.

For example, if you create a subscription with the start date of the current date and specify a subscription period of 30 days,
it will generate a subscription bill with the current date as the due date and will generate another bill automatically every 30 days.

:::note
First subscription bill payment have to be requested manually,
afterwards the user will be charged automatically every subscription period.
:::

To create a subscription payment and start billing your user follow the following steps:

1. [Create Subscription](#create-subscription)
2. [Log Subscription bills](#log-subscription-bills)
3. [Pay Subscription bill](#pay-a-subscription-bill)

### Example

The following example uses Axios which is a Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js

<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/axios/axios">
  Axios Github repo
</a>

#### installing

Using npm:

```
$ npm install axios
```

Using jsDelivr CDN:

```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/axios/dist/axios.min.js"></script>
```

Create a new subscription

```jsx
axios({
  method: "post",
  url: "https://staging.xpay.app/api/subscriptions/",
  data: {
    name: "VIP Membership",
    amount: 1500,
    start_date: "2020-11-1",
    period: 1,
    member_id: "69",
    community_id: "m2J7eBK",
    end_date: "2020-11-30",
  },
  headers: {
    "x-api-key": "Cce74Y3B.J0P4tItq7hGu2ddhCB0WF5ND1eTubkpT",
  },
})
  .then((response) => {
    console.log(response.data.data);
  })
  .catch((e) => {
    console.log(e.response.data.status);
  });
```

log output

```json
{
  "id": 1593,
  "name": "VIP Membership",
  "amount": "1500.00",
  "start_date": "2020-11-01",
  "end_date": "2020-11-30",
  "period": 1,
  "community_id": "m2J7eBK",
  "member_id": "69"
}
```

:::note
If you try to run the above code in your client you will get an error saying that the member id is used before,
this is because subscriptions are linked to membership ids and the same community can't have duplicate membership ids.

Try changing the value of the member_id randomly till it work.
