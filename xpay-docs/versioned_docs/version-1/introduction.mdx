The XPay API is organized around REST.
Our API accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses and uses standard HTTP response codes and authentication.

You can use the XPay API in test mode, which does not affect your live data or interact with the banking networks.

The base url of the request url determines whether the request is live mode or test mode.

### Testing base url

```

### Live base url
